# Java Sorting Algorithms and Optimization

Just a bunch of sorting algorithms written and Java. The program also compares runtimes and graphs performance.

### Current Progress:
- have sorter base class
- method performance recorded by time in nanoseconds
- tester class
- random data generator

### Todo:
- implement specific sort algorithm classes
- graph performance
